# 🧠 Fortytwo Node Guide

This guide helps you set up and run a Fortytwo Node on a Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) server — no `sudo` access required.

---

## 📌 What is Fortytwo?

Fortytwo is a decentralized AI protocol built on swarm intelligence — where small AI models run across a distributed network of user-contributed devices. Instead of relying on centralized data centers, Fortytwo scales AI using idle resources from your system.

By running a node, you contribute compute power and earn rewards (in Points) based on your device’s performance.

## ⚙️ System Requirements (Linux Only)

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 10+
- **CPU**: 8-core processor
- **RAM**: 16 GB+

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Installation (No `sudo` required)

```bash
# 1. Create a working directory
mkdir -p ~/Fortytwo && cd ~/Fortytwo

# 2. Download the app
curl -L -o fortytwo-console-app.zip https://github.com/Fortytwo-Network/fortytwo-console-app/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

# 3. Extract using Python (no unzip needed)
python3 -m zipfile -e fortytwo-console-app.zip fortytwo-console-app-main

# 4. Enter directory
cd fortytwo-console-app-main

# 5. Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x linux.sh && ./linux.sh
````

## 💡 Recommended: Run in Background with `tmux`

If `tmux` isn’t installed and you don’t have `sudo`, do this:

```bash
# 1. Download prebuilt tmux binary
curl -LO https://github.com/nelsonenzo/tmux-appimage/releases/download/v3.3a/tmux.appimage
chmod +x tmux.appimage
./tmux.appimage
```

Inside tmux, start the node and detach:

```bash
# Start session
./tmux.appimage new-session -s node

# Inside session
cd ~/Fortytwo/fortytwo-console-app-main
./fortytwo-console-app
# Press Ctrl+B then D to detach
```

To reattach later:

```bash
./tmux.appimage attach-session -t node
```

---

## 🧠 Choose Your Specialization

When prompted, select one of the heavy-tier specializations (e.g., `4` for *Programming & Algorithms* with OlympicCoder).

---

## 🛑 Stop the Node

In your tmux session, just press:

```
Ctrl+C
```

---

## 📞 Support

Join the [Fortytwo Discord](https://discord.gg/fortytwo-ai) and look for the node support channel.
