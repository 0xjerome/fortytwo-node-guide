## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Node in Background (with `tmux`)

If you don‚Äôt have `sudo` and need to keep the node running after you log out:

1. **Install tmux manually (no sudo)**
   Run from home dir:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   curl -LO https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/3.3a/tmux-3.3a.tar.gz
   tar -xzf tmux-3.3a.tar.gz
   cd tmux-3.3a
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
   make && make install
   ```

2. **Add tmux to PATH**

   ```bash
   export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
   ```

3. **Start the node inside tmux**

   ```bash
   tmux new -s node
   cd ~/Fortytwo/fortytwo-console-app-main
   ./linux.sh
   ```

4. **Detach from tmux (keep node running)**
   Press: `Ctrl + B`, then `D`

5. **Reconnect later**

   ```bash
   tmux attach -t node
   ```

## üß† Node Model Selection

During setup, you'll be asked to select your node's specialization. For **high rewards**, we recommend:

```
4 ‚¨¢ PROGRAMMING & ALGORITHMS - OlympicCoder 32B Q4
```

This model uses \~20GB VRAM and is suitable if your GPU is RTX 4090 or similar.

---

## ‚ùå Stopping the Node

If you're inside the tmux session, press:

```bash
Ctrl + C
```

Or simply kill the session:

```bash
tmux kill-session -t node
```
